Algorithm InsertionSort
Input: An array arr with n elements
Output: The array arr sorted in ascending order

Begin
    For i from 1 to n-1 do
        key ← arr[i]
        j ← i - 1

        // Move elements of arr[0..i-1] that are greater than key
        // to one position ahead of their current position
        While j >= 0 and arr[j] > key do
            arr[j + 1] ← arr[j]
            j ← j - 1
        End While

        arr[j + 1] ← key
    End For
End
